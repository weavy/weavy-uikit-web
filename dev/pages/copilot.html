      <h1 id="important-weavy-concepts">Important Weavy concepts</h1>
      <p>This article discusses some important Weavy concepts. Understanding them will help you make the most of Weavy
        when adding it to your application.</p>
      <h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
      <p>One of the most important concepts to grasp is the <a href="/docs/learn/environment">environment</a>. To put
        it simply, an environment is the backend/server part of Weavy that keeps track of all interactions and data
        created when users collaborate using Weavy functionality.</p>
      <h2 id="component">Component</h2>
      <p>A Weavy <a href="/docs/learn/components">component</a> is an interactive building block you add to your UI to
        enable Weavy functionality in your application. The component communicates with your Weavy environment using
        standard HTTP requests.</p>
      <h2 id="app">App</h2>
      <p>Many Weavy components are backed by a corresponding <em>app</em> in the Weavy environment. The app is
        required for permission and access control, and for keeping track of data generated when users interact with a
        Weavy component.</p>
      <p>Apps are normally created automatically by components when needed, but for better access control and
        individually assigning permissions you can also use the <a href="/docs/reference/api/apps">Apps API</a> to
        create apps ahead of time or to modify already created apps.</p>
      <h4 id="app-identifiers">App identifiers</h4>
      <p>When creating apps you can specify a <code>uid</code> which is a string that uniquely identifies the app. One
        thing to consider when generating app identifiers is that it is often useful being able to do a reverse lookup
        from a <code>uid</code> to a location in your app. It is therefore a good idea to base the <code>uid</code> on
        something that identifies the location in your app where the Weavy component is being rendered. Typically you
        would use something like a product id, page id, path or URL.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Note that the <code>uid</code> cannot contain whitespace and must contain at least one non-digit.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4 id="access-control">Access control</h4>
      <p>Controlling access to apps can be done on two levels. First you can set the <code>access</code> property whan
        creating the app. This property defines the permissions for users who are <strong>not</strong> members of the
        app. Additionally, the <code>directory</code> property let's you reference a
        <a href="#directory">user directory</a> and is used in combination with <code>access</code> to specify that
        only users in a specific directory can access the app.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want an <em>open</em> app where all authenticated users are allowed to create content: set
          <code>access=write</code>.
          <em>This is the default when apps are created automatically by components.</em>
        </li>
        <li>If you want a <em>read-only</em> app where users can see content but cannot create anything: set
          <code>access=read</code>.
        </li>
        <li>If you want a <em>closed</em> app that only members can access: set <code>access=none</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By adding members to an app you can override the default <code>access</code> property on the app for
        individual users. Adding members to an app is done with the
        <a href="/docs/reference/api/apps#upsert-member">upsert member</a> endpoint in the
        <a href="/docs/reference/api/apps">Apps API</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want to give a member permission to create content in the app: set <code>access=write</code>.
          <em>This is the default when members are added to an app.</em>
        </li>
        <li>If you want to give a member permission to read content in the app: set <code>access=read</code>.</li>
        <li>If you want to block a member from accessing the app: set <code>access=none</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have a large number of users that should have to access an app it is often convenient to set
        <code>access</code> on the app to <code>read</code> or <code>write</code>. If needed you can also define a few
        members with different <code>access</code>, for instance <code>none</code> to block them from accessing the
        app.
      </p>
      <p>For maximum control over who can access an app, set <code>access=none</code> on the app and define members
        with individual <code>access</code> levels. You could for instance give <code>write</code> access to a few
        members, and <code>read</code> access to others.</p>
      <h2 id="user">User</h2>
      <p>In order to integrate Weavy, your application must have some sort of <em>user</em> system in place, and there
        must be a way to identify the currenty logged in user. Weavy then provides a mechanism for
        <a href="/docs/learn/authentication">seamless authentication</a> and for syncing profile information from your
        application to the Weavy environment.
      </p>
      <h4 id="syncing-users">Syncing users</h4>
      <p>Users in your application are automatically added to the Weavy environment as part of the authentication
        processs, but syncing them in advance or on a schedule can improve the experience for features like @mentions
        and direct messages.</p>
      <p>To keep the user details (name, email, profile picture etc) up to date in Weavy, you can use the
        <a href="/docs/reference/api/users">Users API</a>. We recommend updating Weavy's user records whenever a user
        is updated in your application, such as during sign-up or when a user updates their profile.
      </p>
      <h4 id="user-identifiers">User identifiers</h4>
      <p>As part of the authentication process and when syncing users to Weavy you need to supply a
        <code>uid</code> property. The <code>uid</code> is a string that uniquely identifies your user (typically your
        internal user id).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Note that the uid cannot contain whitespace and must contain at least one non-digit, for instance, if a
          user has the integer id <code>256</code> in your system you can create a <code>uid</code> by adding a one
          letter prefix, e.g. <code>u256</code>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="directory">Directory</h2>
      <p><em>User directories</em> is an advanced concept for multi-tenant scenarios where you want multiple
        applications and/or organizations using the same Weavy environment while making sure users in the different
        directories cannot see each other.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can only be members in one directory at a time.</li>
        <li>User within the same directory can always interact with each other.</li>
        <li>Users in different directories cannot see or interact with each other.</li>
        <li>By adding users from different directories as members of the same
          <a href="/docs/concepts#apps">app</a> they can interact with each other <em>regardless</em> of the directory
          they are in. This enables communication across organizations, something which is not possible with multiple
          environments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To specify that a user belongs to a directory, use the <a href="/docs/reference/api/users">Users API</a> and
        specify a <code>directory</code> when creating or updating a user.</p>
